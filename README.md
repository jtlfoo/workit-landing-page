## Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

## What was done

### 2024.08.25

-   Remembering how to set up the variables, resets, and identifying problems that occurred during the initial portfolio build
-   Try not to set up tailwind classes without using tailwind yet. For example, setting a `flex-vertical` class only to have to undo it at larger screens is not good practice
-   Only set up the tailwind classes if they are consistent among all screen sizes
-   Need to set up variables more intelligently. Identify what the sizes are from the style guide and have a system for referencing them ie. Kevin Powell's 400
-   Find out of the `fontsize: 62.5%` is bad practice

### 2024.08.27
- forgetting what everything is called
- you never know what to name anything
- New property: `clip-path`
	- This property 
- Need to understand `position: reative, absolute` better
- Will figure out how to do the image overlaps and background botom curves

### 2024.08.28
- Less is more.
- Spent most of the day figuring out the bottom curve. Lesson is, you don't have to position relative or absolute a bunch of stuff. Sometimes it's just creating a property with the shape, then repositioning 1 element to overlap it.
- Careful were you name your background colors. They get tricky with the curves if you're doing it this way.
- Be cautious where you declare your spacing as well. Had to find the "gap" that was separating the background colors because it was in the `flex-wrapper`


### Continued development
